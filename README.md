## WORK IN PROGRESS

I am Alexandre Courtiol, a quantitative wildlife biologist based at IZW Berlin.

For info on my research group, check out www.datazoogang.de

This page is a guide to my GitHub den: it indicates what to find where.

### R packages maintained by me released on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)
- [lay](https://github.com/courtiol/lay): a simple and efficient implementation of rowwise jobs
- [IsoriX](https://github.com/courtiol/IsoriX) & [IsoriX_project](https://github.com/courtiol/IsoriX_project): isoscape computation and inference of spatial origins using mixed models
  
### R packages maintained by me but not released on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)
- [hyenaR](https://github.com/courtiol/hyenaR) (private)
- [manyfold](https://github.com/courtiol/manyfold): explore data by folding columns 

### R packages reproducing analyses/results of some of my scientific papers
- [gallbladdeR](https://github.com/courtiol/gallbladdeR): for a paper about the evolution of gallbladders (private)
- [isoMM](https://github.com/courtiol/isoMM): for a paper in prep about isoscapes and mixed models (private)
- [matingRhinos](https://github.com/courtiol/matingRhinos): for a paper about mate choice and mating success in white rhinos
- [SileR](https://github.com/courtiol/SileR): for a paper about survivorship on Asian elephants
- [twinR](https://github.com/courtiol/twinR): for a paper about the relation between twinning rates and fertility in humans
- [winteR](https://github.com/courtiol/winteR) & [winteR_old_private](https://github.com/courtiol/winteR_old_private): for a paper on bat hibernation and climate change
 
### Forks to R packages from others to which I contributed
I have used these repos to propose some changes in R packages maintained by other people.

So please refer to the original repos to know more about these packages.
- [adegenet](https://github.com/courtiol/adegenet)
- [adRes](https://github.com/courtiol/adRes)
- [distillery](https://github.com/courtiol/distillery)
- [lattice](https://github.com/courtiol/lattice)
- [pedigree](https://github.com/courtiol/pedigree) & [pedigreeCRAN](https://github.com/courtiol/pedigreeCRAN) (same package, but different forks for the time being)
- [torpor](https://github.com/courtiol/torpor_fork)

### Experimental largely unfinished projects that are not R packages
- [choosiness](https://github.com/courtiol/choosiness): an individual based model to study choosiness built (old project with Robert Schwieger)
- [mating_pattern](https://github.com/courtiol/mating_pattern): an algorithm to infer mating preferences (old project with Robert Schwieger)
- [IUCN](https://github.com/courtiol/IUCN): an attempt to parse IUCN data (for a group project with students of the Freie University, Berlin)
- [Vullioud_PhD](https://github.com/courtiol/Vullioud_PhD): material for work with Colin Vullioud

### Teaching material
- [introR](https://github.com/courtiol/introR) (a fork)
- [BeginR](https://github.com/courtiol/BeginR): a short introduction to R
- [R4Genetics](https://github.com/courtiol/R4Genetics): a short introduction to population genetics

### Debugging material for reporting issues
- [testenvrmarkdown](https://github.com/courtiol/testenvrmarkdown)
  
### Miscelanious
- [courtiol](https://github.com/courtiol/courtiol): the repo to modify the page you are reading right now
- [todo](https://github.com/courtiol/todo): an attempt at creating a todo list for everything in life (private)
