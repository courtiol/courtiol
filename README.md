# Alex's GitHub Den

I am Alexandre Courtiol, a quantitative wildlife biologist based at IZW Berlin.

For info on my research group, check out www.datazoogang.de

This page is motivated by the fact that most people using GitHub (including me) fail to organise their repositories using a coherent hierarchical system.

Instead all the repos lay at the root, forming a growing mess.

I have thus created this page as a guide to my GitHub den: it indicates what to find where.

I have also included a few repos to which I contributed and which are not stored under my personal GitHub account. 

I did this for myself, but perhaps it can be useful for others too (if only as an inspiration).
